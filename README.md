****📊 CareerFoundry Data Analytics – Rockbuster SQL Case Study 🔍****

****📌 Project Overview****
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a fictional movie rental company, wants to expand its business and compete with streaming services like Netflix. This project analyzes Rockbuster’s rental data using SQL to uncover key business insights and provide data-driven recommendations.

As a Data Analyst, I leveraged structured query language (SQL) to extract, clean, and analyze Rockbuster's database, identifying trends in customer behavior, rental patterns, and revenue generation.

****🎯 Key Business Questions & Objectives****
This analysis answers critical business questions, including:

**✅ Customer Insights** – Who are Rockbuster's top customers? Which locations generate the highest revenue?

**✅ Rental Trends** – What are the most rented movies? How do rental patterns vary by region?

**✅ Revenue Analysis** – Which genres contribute the most to total revenue?

**✅ Operational Strategy** – What factors impact rental frequency and revenue growth?

**✅ Market Expansion** – Which cities/countries should Rockbuster target for future growth?

By addressing these questions, the project provides data-driven strategies to enhance Rockbuster’s profitability and competitive edge.

****📂 Dataset Information****
The dataset is stored in PostgreSQL and consists of multiple relational tables:
**🏷Customer Data** - Customer demographics, rental frequency, and purchase behavior.

**🎬 Film & Inventory** - Movie details, genres, and rental availability.

**🔄 Rental Transactions** – Rental history, duration, and return rates.

**💰 Payment Records**– Customer payments and revenue breakdown.
Data was cleaned, structured, and analyzed using SQL queries to extract meaningful business insights.

****🛠️ Tools & Technologies****
This project was executed using the following tools:

**🔹 SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)** – Querying, data manipulation, and aggregation.
