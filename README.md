CareerFoundry Data Analytics â€“ Rockbuster SQL Case Study

Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a fictional movie rental company, aims to expand its business and compete with streaming services like Netflix. This project analyzes Rockbusterâ€™s rental data using SQL to uncover key business insights and provide data-driven recommendations.

As a Data Analyst, I utilized Structured Query Language (SQL) to extract, clean, and analyze Rockbuster's database, identifying trends in customer behavior, rental patterns, and revenue generation.

Key Business Questions & Objectives
This analysis answers critical business questions, including:

Customer Insights â€“ Who are Rockbuster's top customers? Which locations generate the highest revenue?
Rental Trends â€“ What are the most rented movies? How do rental patterns vary by region?
Revenue Analysis â€“ Which genres contribute the most to total revenue?
Operational Strategy â€“ What factors impact rental frequency and revenue growth?
Market Expansion â€“ Which cities/countries should Rockbuster target for future growth?
By addressing these questions, the project provides data-driven strategies to enhance Rockbusterâ€™s profitability and competitive edge.

Dataset Information
The dataset is stored in PostgreSQL and consists of multiple relational tables:

Customer Data â€“ Customer demographics, rental frequency, and purchase behavior.
Film & Inventory â€“ Movie details, genres, and rental availability.
Rental Transactions â€“ Rental history, duration, and return rates.
Payment Records â€“ Customer payments and revenue breakdown.
Data was cleaned, structured, and analyzed using SQL queries to extract meaningful business insights.

Tools & Technologies
This project was executed using the following tools:

SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL) â€“ Querying, data manipulation, and aggregation.
Jupyter Notebook â€“ Organizing and refining SQL queries.
Tableau Public â€“ Creating interactive data visualizations.
Excel â€“ Supplementary data analysis and reporting.
GitHub â€“ Version control and project documentation.
Interactive Visualizations
I have created interactive dashboards in Tableau Public to visually represent key insights from the analysis.
